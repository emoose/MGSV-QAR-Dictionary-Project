CityHook
--------

Allows you to monitor all CityHash calls made by MGS, each time the CityHash functions are called the value being hashed will be logged to [MGS-dir]\logger.log

Three compiled versions are provided:
- CityHook_paths.dll: will only log values that look like paths (contain a '/' or '\\' character, or end in .lua/.json/.fpk(d)/.ftexs)
- CityHook_all.dll: will log ALL CityHash calls, might be useful for finding matches for other things besides QAR archives (will probably slow your game down a bit though!)
- CityHook_withhashes.dll: same as CityHook_all, but also outputs the hash generated by the game for each value (you might need to AND these hashes with 0x3FFFFFFFFFFFF for them to match archive hashes), values are output in the format [value]___:___[decimal hash]

(the DLLs are all built with Visual Studio 2017, make sure you have "Visual C++ 2017 redistributable" installed to use them!)

To install just rename the DLL of your choice to dinput8.dll and copy it next to mgv.exe.

Source code is included, right now it's only setup for Survive 1.02 but it should be easy to port to other Fox Engine titles. (you may need to remove SteamStub first though)  
(tip: try searching the exe for the constants used by CityHash, eg. 0x9ae16a3b2f90404f, you might need to reverse the constant to be little-endian first though)

Source for the withhashes version is in a seperate file dllmain_withhashes.cpp, replace the other dllmain.cpp with that to use it.  
This version uses slightly different CityHash hooks so that we can capture the hash after it's been fully generated, while the other version just hooks the main CityHash function directly, either one may give better results depending on what you're looking for.

If you have any problems please feel free to post on the issue tracker!
